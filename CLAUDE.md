Terminal is a native macOS terminal workspace: SwiftUI around libghostty surfaces, with projects,
panes, a file tree, a git panel, an editor, and a diff viewer. AppKit used over SwiftUI where performance matters.

- [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) — who Terminal is for; product and design calls follow from it.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — build, verify, and what a PR must say. Read before opening one.
- [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) — maintainer-only. Never bump the version in a PR.

## Verify

Build, run the app, and exercise the change — a successful build says nothing
about whether the change works. `cargo test` in `Vendor/alacritty-bridge` when
you touch the Rust bridge. Requires Xcode 27; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Conventions

- Match the file you're in. Comments explain *why* — keep them, add them.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is the product changelog for end users, not a
  development log. Describe only the final user-visible outcome intended to
  ship. Never add or revise release notes for incremental fixes, refactors,
  implementation details, or regressions introduced and resolved while a
  feature is still in progress on an unreleased branch.
