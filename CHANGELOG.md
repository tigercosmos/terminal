# Changelog

All notable changes to terminal. This file is the **source of truth for the release
notes shown in the in-app updater**: [`scripts/release.ts`](scripts/release.ts)
extracts the section whose heading matches the version being released
(`MARKETING_VERSION`) and publishes it next to the update, so Sparkle shows it in
the update prompt.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Add a new
`## [<version>]` section at the top for each release, matching the version you
set in the Xcode project.

Write release notes for the final product users receive, not the development
history. When a feature is still unreleased, fold its fixes and refinements into
the original feature bullet instead of adding separate entries for them.

## [unrelease]

- The Files panel follows a terminal onto the host it has connected to: `ssh`
  somewhere and the file tree shows that machine's files, browsable and
  openable read-only over the same connection you are already using. Files,
  Git, and Compare still describe your Mac, which is where the checkout is
- Compare your working tree against any branch or commit and keep editing: the
  target sits read-only beside your live file, a Compare panel lists every file
  that differs, each line shows who last changed it, and any file can be
  reverted to the target
- Opening files is much faster: switching back to an open file is now instant
  (keeping its undo history), and large files no longer stall while scrolled
  away from the top
- Add per-pane live titles and split controls in split layouts, where splitting
  divides only the focused pane and leaves its neighbors at the size you gave
  them
- The Files panel now shows repository status with colored filenames and
  badges, including dimmed Git-ignored files
- Zoom the terminal text with Cmd+Plus (or Cmd+=) and Cmd+Minus, or Cmd+0 for
  the default size, without opening Settings — in a browser pane the same keys
  zoom the page
- Switch directly to tabs with Ctrl+1–9, without also holding Shift
- The Ctrl-Tab switcher now lists tabs in the order you last used them and opens
  already pointing at the previous tab, so a quick Ctrl-Tab flips between the
  two tabs you're working in
- Opening a folder no longer lets that repository's own Git configuration run
  commands on your machine
- Terminal links that would leave your browser and launch an application now ask
  first, showing where the link really leads
- Editing a symlinked file writes through the link instead of replacing it
- Saving a file that changed on disk since you opened it now offers to overwrite
  or reload instead of silently discarding the other change
- Saved terminal history is now readable only by your user account

## [0.1.34]

- Show terminal titles verbatim while keeping sidebar project rows stable as titles update or hover controls appear
- Follow the terminal's foreground job into another checkout: when an agent
  switches to its own git worktree, Files, Git and Info re-root to it
- Settings font preview now reflects “Thicken font strokes”
- Prevent terminal tabs from crashing after switching sessions or resizing during a partial redraw
- Files created in a terminal now use your system's default permissions instead of being made private to your user

## [0.1.33]

- Fix: never set `LANG` env for the terminal session

## [0.1.32]

- Add native English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese localization throughout the app, with a language picker in Settings
- Search and open files from the project directory in the command palette
- Open native browser tabs and split panes from the command palette or terminal/editor context menus, with a combined address/search field, navigation controls, page sharing, and restored URLs

## [0.1.31]

- File previews now refresh after files are changed outside Terminal
- Option-key characters from macOS input sources such as Polish Pro now work in terminals; users who prefer terminal Meta bindings can opt in under Settings → Terminal

## [0.1.30]

- Fix Chinese IME under Alacritty backend
- Reduce hidden Ghostty tab renderer memory

## [0.1.29]

- Add `terminal` command: run `terminal` in any Terminal terminal to create a project in the current directory, optionally with an argv to run directly (`terminal vim ~/foo.js`); `terminal +themes` browses themes with a live app-wide preview and saves the selection on Return
- The Git panel now refreshes after commands and when Terminal regains focus instead of polling continuously in the background

## [0.1.28]

- Tweak some UI colors

## [0.1.27]

- Choose which terminal emulator drives new panes in Settings → Terminal → Backend. Ghostty remains the default, with a new Alacritty backend
- Configure the left and right sidebar font size in Settings

## [0.1.26]

- Opening the Ctrl-Tab switcher no longer highlights whichever tab happens to be under the stationary pointer
- The Processes list no longer shows `<defunct>` entries: those are exited children waiting to be reaped, not something you can see output from or kill
- Opening a large diff no longer freezes the window: diffs render only the rows on screen and highlight them off the main thread
- The font setting now applies to the diff viewer too, so diffs match the terminal and the editor
- Sessions you never open no longer cost any GPU memory. Reopening a window used to draw every restored session straight away, holding a full-size buffer for each whether you looked at it or not; now a pane claims one only when you first view it, and claims one buffer less than before. A pane you have already viewed keeps its buffer until you close it — switching away stops it drawing, but does not hand the memory back.

## [0.1.25]

- Add a tab switcher (ctrl-tab) to switch between tabs
- Add audio input support for CLIs that might need it

## [0.1.24]

- set TERM_PROGRAM to ghostty to get image rendering support

## [0.1.23]

- Fix pasting clipboard images into image-aware TUIs such as Grok, and paste Finder-copied files as shell-safe absolute paths (#20)

## [0.1.22]

- Add “Open in Terminal” to Finder’s folder context menu, opening each selected folder as a project with its terminal started there
- Full-screen programs with their own background color (vim, htop, TUIs) now fill the terminal pane: the padding around the grid takes on the adjacent content's background instead of always showing the theme background, leaving only a hairline frame at the pane edges
- Fix non-ASCII rendering in git diff view
- Allow to rename session tabs

## [0.1.21]

- Anchor the file tree and Git panel to the project directory — the closest git repository containing the terminal's directory — so they no longer re-root every time you `cd` inside a repo; outside a repository they keep following the terminal as before
- Add "Set Project Directory…" to the project's context menu to pin a fixed directory for these panels ("Use Automatic Directory" reverts); the pin is remembered across relaunches
- Info panel: the Directory section is now split into Current Directory (the shell's live cwd, shown when it differs) and Project Directory, marked "(AUTO)" while derived automatically, with a "?" popover explaining both modes
- Remember sidebar layout across relaunches: each window restores whether the left and right sidebars were open and which right panel (Files/Git/Info) was selected

## [0.1.20]

- Security: stop terminal programs from silently reading your clipboard — an OSC 52 escape sequence (for example from a remote SSH host) could previously read the macOS clipboard without any prompt; terminal now asks for confirmation first, matching the Ghostty app default (#8)
- Warn before pasting text that looks like it could execute commands, matching Ghostty's paste protection
- Add color themes: Settings → Colors picks a theme per appearance — terminal's Default Light/Dark plus all 485 bundled Ghostty themes — recoloring the terminal, window chrome, sidebars, and editor live. The built-in Defaults keep the GitHub palette and translucent sidebar; every other theme colors the sidebar too
- Fix fuzzy-looking terminal text: font thickening was unintentionally always on, making glyphs heavier and softer than stock Ghostty
- Add a "Thicken font strokes" toggle in Settings → Font for those who prefer the heavier rendering

## [0.1.19]

- Fix a releasing signing issue

## [0.1.18]

- Fix max height of settings window

## [0.1.17]
